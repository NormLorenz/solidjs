A general Component has no implicit children prop. If desired, you can specify one as in Component<{name: String, children: JSX.Element}>.

```bash
# to launch the app
> npm start
```

```bash
# install the router
> npm install @solidjs/router
```

```bash
# install bootstrap
> npm install bootstrap
> npm install bootstrap-icons
```

## to refresh the site
edit <code>src/App.tsx</code> and save to reload.
